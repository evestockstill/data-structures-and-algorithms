I read a lot about the stacks. I understand that the stack operates on a first in last out basis. or a last in first out. which is different than a queue which has a first in first out. There are methods that can go with the stack like push, pop, peek. you can push something onto the stack, and you can pop something off the top of the stack. You can see what is on the top of the stack by using peek. The examples of the input and output for this challenge you would use the push method to put the five at the end of the queue which would then be the last to get out. The other example is to pop the 20 off which is the front of the queue it then is removed and the number next inline will be the new first out.
