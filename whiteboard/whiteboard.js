// Familiarize yourself with the grading rubric, so you know how to score the interview.

// Look for effective problem solving, efficient use of time, and effective communication with the whiteboard space available.

// Every solution might look a little different, but the candidate should be able to at least convince you that their code works to solve the problem.

// Assign points for each item on the Rubric, according to how well the candidate executed on that skill.

// Add up all the points at the end, and record the total at the bottom of the page.

//   Example
// Input	Output
// [[1, 2, 3], [3, 5, 7], [1, 7, 10]][6, 15, 18]
// [[0, 1, 5], [-4, 7, 2], [-3, 12, 11]][6, 5, 20]
// The candidate should draw the input and output as a square of integers.
