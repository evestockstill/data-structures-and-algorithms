ST = subtree

In order for the tree to be searched must have a ordering property. the value stored at any node has to be greater than values stored in left ST and small than the right ST. 

Pre order traversal on the tree does the following which starts at the root. 
 * It returns the rood node value
 * traverse the left ST through recursively calling a pre-order function
* traverse right ST through recursively calling a pre-order function
        PRE-ORDER
Maintaining an array of order for the nodes for the preOrder
        IN-ORDER
in order traversal preforms these steps
* traverse the left ST by recursively call in-order function
* returning the root node value
* traverse the right ST by recursively call in-order function 
        POST-ORDER
* traverse the left ST by recursively calling the post-order function
* traverse the right ST by recursively calling the post-order function
* return the root node value

adding a new node to the tree
insert method performs binary search on the root node, moving to the left child if n is less than the current node or right if n is greater than the current node. This continues until the left or right child does not exist, which is where the new node will then be inserted.

contains 
preforms binary search similar to insert to determine if n exist
