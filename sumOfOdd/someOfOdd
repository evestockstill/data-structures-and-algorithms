first you want to traverse the Binary Search tree and check to see if the current node has a odd value. If the tree is not empty find the path between any two nodes. 
you create a Node = new Node()
node.data = data and set the left and right node to null, and return the node.
if the root is null and no path return false
you will push the values of the node into an array. You will have to check if the node is % 2 if it is not divisible by 2 then push those values into the array. Once you have the odd values into an array add the sum of those values.

I did have a little trouble finding out information on this one. This is my best understanding of it.
