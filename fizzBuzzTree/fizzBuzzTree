first you will have to make defaults of Node
then make a tree class where you add data
search the trees
you will then have to find if the fizzbuzz tree has value and return tree if the tree head is null
the value is equal to the node data
if the left node is or right node is determined to be left or right not -
then see if the value is %15 === 0 the value (node.data)is then equal to fizzbuzz
if the value is %5 === 0 value (node.data) = buzz
if the value is %3 === 0 value (node.data) = fizz
